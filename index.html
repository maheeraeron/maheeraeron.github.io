                <h3>Microsoft COSINE BASE - High Availability and Storage</h3>
                <h4>Software Engineer Intern | June 2019 - August 2019</h4>
                <p> I was an intern in the Windows Operating System division and worked on Storage and Clustering
                    Technologies. SDDC Management is a resource used in hyper-converged, failover clusters for Windows
                    Servers equipped with Storage Spaces Direct. Using C++ and Windows PowerShell cmdlets, I developed a
                    feature within the SDDC Management Resource Type Dll to support versioning between RS5 and 19H1
                    builds of Windows Server. This allowed enterprises to utilize Windows hyper-converged clustering
                    technology support for their servers when running mixed-mode clusters during server upgrades. </p>

                <h3>Assurance INC.</h3>
                <h4>Software Engineer | June 2018 - May 2019</h4>
                <p> Assurance designs and develops software solutions for major retail and government organizations in
                    the US. I was involved in design and development of a web-based API for production and performance
                    recording application for Ross Inc. I was also involved in a mobile application development that was
                    part of an inventory management application. </p>
